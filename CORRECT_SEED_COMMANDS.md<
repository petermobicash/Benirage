# 🚀 CORRECT Seed File Commands for Your Setup

## ✅ Your Configuration

I can see from your `supabase/config.toml` that:
- **Database Port:** `54322` 
- **Seed File:** Already configured at `sql_paths = ["./seed.sql"]`
- **Auto-seed:** Enabled with `enabled = true`

## 🎯 EASIEST Method (Automatic)

Since seeding is enabled in your config, just run:
```bash
cd /home/peter/Desktop/beniweb/Benirage
supabase db reset
```

This will:
- ✅ Reset your database to clean state
- ✅ Apply all migrations automatically
- ✅ Run the seed file automatically
- ✅ Populate with all sample data

## 🔄 Alternative Methods (Manual)

### Method 1: Supabase CLI Seed Only
```bash
# If you don't want to reset, just seed
supabase db seed
```

### Method 2: Direct SQL Execution
```bash
# Using the correct port from your config
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres" \
  -f supabase/seed.sql
```

### Method 3: Via Local Dashboard
1. Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:54323`
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy/paste contents of `supabase/seed.sql`
4. Click **Run**
